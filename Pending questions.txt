Questions:
Why isn't my contact table migrating and seeding into my app database? (it's working in )
How do I generate a random list of thank you's?

Possible errors:
8:00pm: creating multiple helper files - watch out for duplicate entries
8:07pm: updated contact.rb to be connected to my other tables


To Dos:
Figure out how to display a table of contact_id and name
Connect etanproject.org@gmail.com to contextio API
Create helper file with all contextio commands
Figure out how to edit existing table (build out that functionality)
