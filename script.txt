Good bye.
What did you say about my mother?


Alfred the Botler is based on Batman's british butler Alfred Pennyworth. Alfred the Botler is highly educated, but as a bot can be a bit simple. He's learning his new role and soon will be up in tip top shape.

As far as his character, he is extremely polished and well behaved, but at times he becomes quite the snarky bastard and his remarks will get a bit off colored. You'll have to watch out for him.
