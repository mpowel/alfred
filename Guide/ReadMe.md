# Alfred the Botler Guide

### Who is Alfred?
Alfred the Botler is based on Batman's british butler Alfred Pennyworth. Alfred the Botler is highly educated, but as a bot can be a bit simple. He's learning his new role and soon will be up in tip top shape.

He is extremely polished and well behaved, but at times he becomes quite snarky and his remarks may get a bit off colored. You'll have to watch out for him, especially when you `dismiss` him.

### What can he do?
Alfred knows you're very busy and in high demand, which is why he's offered to keep track of your contacts. He's still new, but eventually he'll be able to automatically store new contacts and start writing an email for you!

Sadly, however, at the moment he's only able to take down your contact's name, email, and phone number, view the contact list, or delete a contact.

### Future Integrations
In the future, Alfred will be able to get access to any email account (with your permission of course) and will be able to automatically store contacts and track your engagement with them.

He's a cheaky one, though, so when you say `hi` you'll notice he's already promising you these things.
